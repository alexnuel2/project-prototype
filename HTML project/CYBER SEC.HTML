        <h2>Cybersecurity Overview</h2>
        <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. Key characteristics include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring only authorized individuals access information.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Keeping data accurate and unaltered.</li>
            <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring systems function correctly when needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Common cybersecurity threats include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Viruses and ransomware.</li>
            <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Fraudulent emails attempting to steal information.</li>
            <li><strong>Denial of Service:</strong> Attacks that overwhelm and shut down systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tools like firewalls, encryption, and multi-factor authentication are used to secure data. Careers in cybersecurity range from penetration testers to security analysts, safeguarding sensitive information in sectors like finance, healthcare, and government. Continuous learning and vigilance are critical in this field.</p>
